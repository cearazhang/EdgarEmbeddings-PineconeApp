    "The purpose of this research project is to identify a working definition of analytical. This is the approach I took:\n",
    "1. as a starting point, I checked the 'Content Model Reference' for skills where the description of the skill contained any sister form of the word \"analytical,\" such as analyze, analysis, analytics, etc. To condense this, I simply filtered for the string 'analy.'\n",
    "2. Next, in the skills and occupation data, I looked for all job titles that contained the skills I deemed to have analytical aspects.\n",
    "3. To help build a defintion of 'analytical,' I did textual analysis to gather some insight on some most commonly found words across the skills and occupation descriptions of job positions that have some mention of any sister words of analytical, and analyzed any common themes that the words shared.\n",
    "4. I compiled my own definition of analytical, based off the analysis (in slides)\n",
    "5. To gather some insight on some jobs that would require analytical skills, I grouped the occupation data and looked for job titles that showed up multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations and Improvements\n",
    "1. Textual Analysis can be improved, such as adding features like lemmatization, and building a more complex NLP model\n",
    "2. was not able to use all of Skills data\n",
    "3. a lot of repeats in job titles/descriptions, could lead to potential bias in my approach\n",
    "4. expansion: looking at other factors and demographics, to add more features and better tune weights"
